	<h3>Abstract</h3>
		This is an interactive web tool that make it easy to get the single best picture from multiple exposures taken within the same scene. With the tool it is possible to recompose a photo from a burst of images after the image is photographed. This is done by remove, add, swap or combine objects in each individual photograph into one reference photo. Supported web browsers are Chrome, Firefox and Safari although Chrome is highly recommended. Touch screen is currently not supported.

<div id="instructions"> <h3>Instructions</h3> </div>

<p>These instructions are for the <a href="selScene.html">Demo</a>, the procedure are the same for the web <a href="indexApp.html">App</a>. To Explain the user interface we will take a step by step walk through.</p>

<div id="divID">
	<dt>Step 1 Select reference view</dt>
	<dd>Select your choice of reference image by scrolling the mouse wheel inside the "mosaic view" in this way you can traverse multiple images. To select one base reference image simply click in that highlighted image.
	<div id="sel1"  style= "background-color: white; position: relative; width: 100%; margin:24">
			<center>
			 <img src="../imgs/fp/sel.gif">
		</div>

	</dd>
	<dt>Step 2 Global thresholding</dt>
	<dd>The difference between the reference image and all other images are computed and highlighted, these highlighted areas are called blobs. This allows you to select content to add or remove. Adjust the Global threshold by scroll the mouse wheel in any region except the green one, this is done to split or merge the blobs with each other. </dd>
		<div id="sel1"  style= "background-color: white; position: relative; width: 100%; margin:24">
			<center>
			 <img src="../imgs/fp/global.gif">
		</div>

	</dd>
	<dt>Step 3 Toggle</dt>
	<dd>When a region that you want to change is present click in that region to make changes in the image. You can toggle the content of that specific region by click in it.</dd> <br>
	<dd> The green layer is just an indication that the blob is selected. The content inside the green region are coming from an image other than the reference image. The content inside all other colors then green mean that that content are coming from the reference image. Different colors means that in that area there are differences with respect to the reference image. The reference image in this example only have one other image then the reference image so there is only one blue color indicating differences between these two. To choose a green blob means that when we hit that blend button then the script will automatically blend the content we see inside the green blob into the reference image. </dd>
	<div id="click"  style= "background-color: white; position: relative; width: 100%; margin:24">
		<center>
		 <img src="../imgs/fp/click.gif">
	</div>
	<dt>Step 4 Relative thresholding</dt>
	<dd>Adjust the Relative threshold by scroll the mouse wheel inside any green region, the region you are currently hovering are highlighted by a light-green color to indicate which region you are adjusting.</dd> 

	<div id="rel"  style= "background-color: white; position: relative; width: 100%; margin:24">

	<br>
	<dd>To catch up with <b>Step 2 - 4</b> , these include handling of mouse scroll wheel, mouse point and mouse click when the check box <em>Select Blob</em> is selected. For a comprehensive view see the flowchart.</dd>

	<dt>Step 5 Paint/Erase</dt>
	<dd>If you are not satisfied with what the blob regions are covering you can manually paint or erase the layers by selecting these options in the check-box. Simply paint inside a green region to add paint.</dd>

<h3>Use Case Examples</h3>

<h4>Remove Content</h4>
	<div id="add" style= "background-color: white; position: relative; width: 100%; margin:4">
		<center>
		 <img src="../imgs/fp/ex1a-min.png">
	</div>

<p>We have two photographs taken from a sequence of a two person portrait in a corridor
seen in the figure above to the left. We decide that we only want a portrait of the person in the
the blue shirt. Ideally we want to combine the exposure b down-left where we have that
person looking more relaxed then on exposure a top-left, there is also other details like the
photographer behind our protagonist who accidentally ended up in frame a. So in other
words we want to remove the girl from image frame b. To do this we combine the two
exposures and replace the girl to the right in frame b with the background wall from frame a
to produce the Output result seen in figure c. </p>

<h4>Add content</h4>
<div id="add" style= "background-color: white; position: relative; width: 100%; margin:14">
	<center>
	 <img src="../imgs/fp/ADD-min.png">
</div>
<p>We have three photos taken from the same spot at slightly different times which essentially
resulted in us capturing multiple cars. We have photographies of cars but in several different
frames. The preference could be one single photo where as many cars as possible appear
visible.</p>
<p>Our goal is to put together details from multiple images into one single frame. Here we
are adding details from our pictures into one reference image. So we select one reference
view that will include an area of the multiple cars, this is the middle frame which also
contains a car in the middle. Now we can combine the left cars from the left frame and the
right car from the right frame to create the concise photo we are looking for, see figure d</p>

<h4>Duplicate Content</h4>
<div id="add" style= "background-color: white; position: relative; width: 100%; margin:24">
	<center>
	 <img src="../imgs/fp/DUB-min.png">
</div>
<p>Here we want to capture the motion of two objects namely the skater and the skateboard
in one single frame. The process is very similar to the previous example we are adding up
details from several different pictures into one single frame, but the difference is that it is the same objects we are adding. 
Thus in this example we duplicate the two objects from our set of frames into one single frame.</p>
<p>With this technique one can use several images to, for example "clone" people within a
scene and thereby visualize their path of motion in one single-frame. Of course, the conditions are that we have appropriate data suited to the purpose
in form of multiple photographies of the same scene and also taken from more or less
the same viewpoint. And preferably, the scene in question should contain some form of
dynamics.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Burst</h3>

<p> Burst mode is a good choise when it comes to photographing moving subjects. One example is shooting sports. Sports photography can be hard because sports move fast, the athletes move fast and the fields are big. With the camera in burst mode we can hold down the shutter and pan the camera along when the athletes movement.</p>

<p>Putting the camera settings in to burst mode are good in other situations too.  Animals and children are similar to athletes in the way that the move fast.</p>  

<p>You often only get one chance to capture a snapshot and to do this in a situation where many things  happening at ones, to freezing the moment of a dynamic scene when everything looks right can be a harsh task. </p> 

<p>The success rate is usually low and therefore photographers need good software to to edit down the number of candidates to do post-processing in. It is here our proposal comes into play.</p> 

<p>Magcut is an image editor that let the user rearrange the photographed scene to maximize the visibility or to change the composition. This can be done in several ways either by adding and moving objects or by removing objects within the scene. </p> 

<p>Our application is suited for dynamic scenes where objects are moving. It also allows the camera to move slightly within a scene. We assume that the burst of images provided by the user contains some differences. That is, differences between each single image.</p>
